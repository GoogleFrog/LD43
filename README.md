Skeleton Spring game.
Libraries are included as files (not git submodules) so just pull/push as usual.

To use this for a new game clone it in a separate repository. Do *not* add game-specific modifications. This should be generic and usable for future Spring games as well (think of it is "Z" in SpringABC).
